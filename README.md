# vim-256-colorschemes

This is a collection of 256 color schemes intended for use in console versions of Vim.
Making a color scheme is very tedious work, and often updating color schemes that exist
in the wild is a very frustrating process. The color schemes found here were painstakingly
built with the intent of being explicit and making them easy to modify and maintain. All 
highlighting groups are defined so you can switch between then with no unintended or left over 
side effects.
