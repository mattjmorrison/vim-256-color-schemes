# vim-256-colorschemes

This is a collection of 256 color schemes intended for use in console versions of Vim.
Making a color scheme is very tedious work, and I have found updating color schemes that exist
in the wild is a very frustrating process. The color schemes found here were painstakingly
built with the intent of being explicit and making them easy to modify and maintain. All
highlighting groups are defined, further modification to suit your individual and delicate
sensibilities should be very easy. In the resources directory you will find a helpful script
from Charles Campbell that identifies the highlighting group under the cursor which makes tweaking
these things a breeze. Feeling like you have a weekend to burn and want to make your own from scratch?
Again the resources directory has you hooked up there you will also find a template that has everything
you need laid out for you.
